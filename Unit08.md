**Unit 8: Thermodynamic Properties of Solutions** <span id="8"></span> 
*A solution is a homogeneous mixture comprising two or more substances
that are mutually miscible. Common examples of solutions include Earth’s
atmosphere, salt water, alcoholic beverages, and many metallic alloys.
Compound materials that are not solutions include milk,
precipitate-hardened alloys, and carbon-fiber composites. The special
thermodynamic properties of solutions reflect large entropic
contributions from the atomic or molecular-level disorder that
characterizes most homogeneous solutions. The thermodynamic behavior of
solutions is, in large part, dominated by entropic effects. In this unit
we will identify the thermodynamic driving forces that govern the
formation and stability of solution media. We also will show how the
thermodynamic properties of a solution reflect the physical properties
and interaction dynamics of the molecular constituents of the
solution. *

     Instructions: Watch the video (approximately 50 minutes in length)
    to learn about ideal solutions and their associated vapor pressures.
    Raoult’s law and Henry’s law also are presented in this lecture.
    Raoult’s law applies to the partial vapor pressure of the *solvent*
    component of a solution in the limit of infinite dilution, whereas
    Henry’s law applies to the partial vapor pressure of the *solute*
    component of a solution in the limit of infinite dilution. Observed
    deviations from Raoult’s law and Henry’s law behavior provide
    diagnostics of solute-solvent interactions in solution media. You
    can find the lecture notes for this video here (PDF).  
      
     Watching this lecture should take approximately 1 hour.
