**Unit 2: The First Law of Thermodynamics** <span id="2"></span> 
*The first law of thermodynamics states, simply, that energy is
conserved. While energy can be changed from one form to another—say, by
converting chemical energy into heat by burning a candle and then
converting that heat into mechanical work by heating a gas within a
balloon—energy cannot be gained or lost once all transfers and
conversions of energy are accounted for.*
