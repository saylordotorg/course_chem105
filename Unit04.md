**Unit 4: The Second Law of Thermodynamics** <span id="4"></span> 
*The second law of thermodynamics reflects the universal observation
that moving things eventually stop and broken eggs never can become
whole again. The law expresses this observation in terms of a
thermodynamic parameter known as entropy, which is a measure of the
disorder in a system. Renowned British physicist Sir Arthur Eddington
believed that the second law of thermodynamics is the most fundamental
law of science and that, at its foundation, it is a far broader concept
than is required by the narrow physical laws of our particular
universe. *

Upon successful completion of this unit, you should be able to:
-   state the second law of thermodynamics and its implications for
    chemical reactions;
-   perform entropy calculations around reversible and irreversible
    cycles;

     Instructions: Explore this Java applet, which is based on a thought
    experiment that Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell devised
    nearly 150 years ago in an attempt to disprove the second law of
    thermodynamics. Although Maxwell did not succeed, his idea raised
    interesting questions about the relationship between information and
    entropy. As you explore the applet, try to separate the fast from
    the slow molecules. Are you violating the second law of
    thermodynamics when you attempt this? No, because the amount of
    information needed to do this separation requires quite a large
    energy input!

     Instructions: Review chapter 8 of Dr. Powers’s lecture notes, which
    have been assigned previously in this course. As you read this time,
    focus specifically on sections 8.9 (“Probablistic approach to
    entropy”) and 8.10 (“Summary statement of thermodynamics”) of the
    chapter. Most of the material in this reading will be familiar to
    you from previous assignments in this course. However, whereas
    previously the emphasis was on the definition and interpretation of
    entropy as a macroscopic property of state, here the entropy state
    function is defined in terms of microscopic material properties.
