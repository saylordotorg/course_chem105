**Unit 7: Phase Changes and Phase Equilibria** <span id="7"></span> 
*Phase changes deal with physical transformations of pure substances. An
important kind of equilibrium is one in which the pure substance exists
in two or more states of matter. We exploit this property in many ways
in all branches of science. For example, in chemistry experiments we
often freeze cells in liquid nitrogen vapor, which is in equilibrium
with its liquid in the storage tank. In this unit, you will learn how to
generate phase diagrams and perform calculations related to energy
requirements for phase changes.*
