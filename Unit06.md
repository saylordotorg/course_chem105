**Unit 6: Spontaneous Changes, Chemical Potential, and Equilibrium**
<span id="6"></span> 
*A chemical system is in equilibrium when the activities and
concentrations of the reactants and products do not change with time.
This usually comes about when the forward reaction rate and the reverse
reaction rate are the same. In this situation, known as dynamic
equilibrium, chemical reactions are still in progress, and specific
atoms move between molecules, but the total amount of the various
chemical species remains the same. As we will see, a chemical system in
dynamic equilibrium tends to remain in equilibrium even when it is
disturbed by a change in the conditions associated with the original
equilibrium. Equilibrium is associated with a global minimum in the
relevant free energy function. Metastability is associated with local
minima in the free energy that are separated from the global minimum by
activation energy barriers. Many chemical processes lead to metastable
states rather than an equilibrium state, thus allowing for the
possibility of further, spontaneous change (in the direction of a true,
thermodynamic equilibrium state). Controlling and changing chemical
equilibria is perhaps the most important skill that a chemist must
develop.*

**6.1 Spontaneous Changes in Chemical Systems** <span id="6.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Dr. Howard DeVoe’s *Thermodynamics and Chemistry* (2nd
    ed.): “Chapter 5: Thermodynamic Potentials”**
    Link: Dr. Howard DeVoe’s *Thermodynamics and Chemistry*
    (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.): [“Chapter 5: Thermodynamic
    Potentials”](http://www2.chem.umd.edu/thermobook/v4-screen.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Navigate to chapter 5, starting on page 135, and read
    the chapter through page 149. Pay special attention to section 5.8,
    titled “Criteria for Spontaneity,” beginning on page 145. Also, be
    sure to work through the problems presented at the end of the
    chapter. Note that the criteria for spontaneous change in the
    thermodynamic state of a system depend on both the compositional and
    P-V-T (physical) variables of the system, as well as whether the
    system is isolated, closed, or open with respect to its boundary
    with surroundings. Pay very close attention to how the criteria for
    spontaneous change are expressed in terms of changes in various
    thermodynamic state functions.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 4 hours.
