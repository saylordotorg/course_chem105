**Unit 1: An Introduction to Thermodynamics** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this first unit, you will learn about the important foundational
thermodynamic concepts and terminology that you will need to know in
order to work through the more advanced material presented later in this
course. Any thermodynamic system can be defined by the observer or
experimenter as having particular properties. For example, a system is
called isolated if nothing—neither mass nor energy—can pass through its
boundaries. Another type of system is a closed system, in which mass
cannot pass through the system boundaries, but energy can. Finally, an
open system has completely permeable boundaries; anything can pass in
and out of such a system. You also will examine thermodynamic properties
and states and review common units, relationships, and conversions that
will prove valuable throughout this course. For example, how do you
define pressure? How can you make conversions between SI (metric) and
imperial (English) units? You may be familiar with some or all of these
concepts and tools; if this is the case, you can approach this unit of
the course as a refresher and review of information. *

    equations of state;

    relation to temperature.

    Thermochemistry”](http://mutuslab.cs.uwindsor.ca/schurko/introphyschem/lectures/240_l08.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Note that you previously have encountered the lecture
    6 notes in an earlier subunit of this course. Re-read the lecture 6
    notes (“Work and Heat”) followed by the notes for lectures 7 and 8.
    Focus on how thermodynamic heat is defined and manifested in various
    types of thermodynamic processes, and how heat transactions are
    measured. The heat given off or taken up in chemical reactions is
    addressed in lecture 8 (“Thermochemistry”).  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 3 hours.

-   **Reading: Dr. Howard DeVoe’s *Thermodynamics and Chemistry* (2nd
    ed.): “Chapter 3: The First Law”**
    Link: Dr. Howard DeVoe’s *Thermodynamics and Chemistry*
    (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.): [“Chapter 3: The First
    Law”](http://www2.chem.umd.edu/thermobook/v4-screen.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Navigate to chapter 3, which begins on page 56. In
    this reading you willacquire an understanding of how heat capacity
    quantities are defined and measured. You also will learn about their
    practical significance in the design and uses of material systems.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 4 hours.

     Instructions: Note that you already have encountered these lecture
    notes in earlier subunits; at this point in the course, your review
    of this material is optional and may be used to enrich and reinforce
    the concepts you have explored so far. If you choose to complete
    this optional reading, pay special attention to the excellent
    sections that deal with heat capacity properties (discussed close to
    the end of the lecture notes).
