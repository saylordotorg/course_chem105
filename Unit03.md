**Unit 3: Application of the First Law of Thermodynamics** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In the third unit of this course, you will learn about measuring
thermodynamic properties for reactions and exploring the fundamentals of
how heat engines operate. Steam engines, internal combustion engines,
diesel engines, jet engines, and rocket engines are all heat engines, as
are refrigerators and heat pumps. In ideal cycle analysis, the
operations of these engines will be treated as thermodynamic cycles, and
you will use the first law of thermodynamics to calculate their cycle
efficiency and work output. While such methods overlook effects that
happen in non-ideal systems, this basic approach can be adapted to treat
more realistic engines. Moreover, you can use thermodynamic cycles
(Hess’s law) to arrive at values for thermodynamic state changes that
cannot easily be measured by using the actual path the reaction takes.
Such state changes can be computed by using cycles involving quantities
that you can measure along different paths. *

     Instructions: Watch the video (approximately 55 minutes long) to
    see how one uses calorimetry to obtain the enthalpy of the formation
    of compounds and the enthalpy of reactions. In fact, many
    thermochemical parameters can be measured in a calorimeter. In
    situations in which you cannot measure enthalpy directly, Hess’s law
    allows you to use a thermodynamic cycle (taking a different path) to
    find it. You can find the lecture notes for this video here (PDF).  
      
     Watching this lecture should take approximately 1 hour.
