This course will teach you the fundamentals of thermodynamics.
Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transformations. Energy is
a physical property that can be converted from one form to another in
order to perform work. For example, a stone rolling down a hill is
converting gravitational potential energy into the kinetic energy of
motion. Thermodynamics can be applied to systems we use every day—such
as, for example, heat pumps and refrigerators, internal combustion
engines, batteries, and both electrical and mechanical power generators.
An awareness of thermodynamics will help you examine other concepts
involving chemical processes more quickly and will enable you to
understand why many physical phenomena (such as automobile engines or
chemical explosives) work the way they do. The knowledge you will gain
in this course also will help you determine how much work an object can
put out and predict how to optimize an object’s operation. In this
course, you will learn about the laws of thermodynamics; thermodynamic
principles; ideal and real gases; the phases of matter; and equations of
state and state changes. You also will explore kinetic molecular theory
and statistical mechanics, fields that relate the atomic-level motion of
the high number of small particles that make up a system to the average
thermodynamic behavior of the system as a whole. In this course, you
will concentrate on the large-scale, bulk properties of systems that can
be described using the principles of classical mechanics. In addition to
these large-scale properties, there also are many systems in which
small-scale, quantum-mechanical effects influence or dominate the
behavior of the system as a whole. These quantum-mechanical systems will
be explored in Saylor’s [CHEM106: Physical Chemistry
II](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem106/).

### Course Information

Welcome to Physical Chemistry I. General information on this course and
its requirements can be found below.   
  
 **Course Designers:** Edward Perry, Brian Dodson, and Karen Duca  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course makes use of a range of different
free, online educational materials. The structure of this course is
built around a series of lectures delivered by Dr. Moungi Bawendi and
Dr. Keith Nelson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology titled
“Thermodynamics and Kinetics,” made available by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology’s OpenCourseWare project. All the lecture notes
for this series, as well as some PowerPoint slideshows on kinetics, are
available for bulk download at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s
OpenCourseWare
[website](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-60-thermodynamics-kinetics-spring-2008/download-course-materials/).  
 This course also makes primary use of the following online textbooks:

-   Dr. Howard DeVoe’s [*Thermodynamics and Chemistry *(2<sup>nd</sup>
    ed.)](http://www2.chem.umd.edu/thermobook/v4-screen.pdf) (PDF)
-   The University of Arizona: Dr. W.R. Salzman’s *[“Dynamic Textbook”
    of Physical
    Chemistry](http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/physchem.html) *(HTML)
-   Dr. Stephen Lower’s *[Chem1 Virtual
    Textbook](http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/thermeq/index.html) *(HTML)
-   **I**nstitute of Chemical Technology, Prague: Ing. Anatol
    Malijevský**,** CSc. et al.’s **** *[Physical Chemistry in
    Brief](http://www.vscht.cz/fch/en/tools/breviary-online.pdf) *(PDF)

**Requirements for Completion:** To complete this course, you must work
through all the assigned resources (including readings, interactives,
lectures, videos, and other assignments) and pass the Final Exam with a
grade of 70% or higher. Your score on the Final Exam will be tabulated
as soon as you complete it. If you do not pass the Final Exam, you may
take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately 153 hours to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory
that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit
and assignment. These time advisories should help you plan your time
accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at the time advisories
before beginning this course in order to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit. Then, you can set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 33
hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday night,
Subunit 1.2 (a total of 12.5 hours) on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
nights, etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** For most students, learning thermodynamics is a
cumulative process that involves reviewing previously learned material
so that foundational concepts are solidified and new ideas and
perspectives are discovered with each re-reading. Overall, because many
of the readings in this course are theoretical and therefore very dense,
you may have to re-read them—or at least certain sections of
them—several times to gain mastery of the subject matter. In particular,
some of the resources in this course are assigned more than once so that
you can take time to review key concepts and/or focus on a particular
aspect of an important text. In addition, some readings in this course
have been deemed “optional” and are primarily intended to enrich and
reinforce material you already have learned. These optional readings do
not include time advisories because they are not essential to your
completion of this course.  
  
 It is recommended that you take comprehensive notes as you complete
each reading and assignment in this course. These notes will serve as a
useful tool to you as you review course material and study for the Final
Exam.
