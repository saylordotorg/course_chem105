**Unit 5: The Third Law of Thermodynamics** <span id="5"></span> 
*The third law of thermodynamics is the odd man out, so to speak. The
0th (zeroth) law states that two bodies having the same temperature as a
third have the same temperature as each other; the first law states that
energy is conserved; and the second law states that heat cannot flow
from a cold object to a hot object. These principles seem reasonably
clear, although not beyond dispute. However, the third law is not as
straightforward. It states that as a system approaches absolute zero,
the entropy of the system, in turn, approaches a minimum value. However,
despite the fact that the interpretation of the third law becomes rather
confusing when quantum effects are included, there is no experimental
example or reasonable theoretical result that violates the third law.*

     Instructions: Watch the video (approximately 52 minutes long),
    which describes the third law of thermodynamics and the definition
    of absolute entropy. Although we can never reach absolute zero of
    temperature, it is an important reference point for defining an
    absolute entropy scale. You can find the lecture notes for this
    video here (PDF).  
      
     Watching this lecture should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Read and review chapter 8, which has been assigned
    earlier in this course. As you read this time, focus specifically on
    section 8.8, titled “Entropy of thermo-mechanical mixing,” beginning
    on page 261. This section of the text focuses on the
    entropy-of-mixing phenomenon. The entropy-of-mixing phenomenon
    accounts for the spontaneous mixing of two or more substances under
    conditions in which the mixing process is isoenergetic.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 2 hours.
