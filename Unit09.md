**Unit 9: Statistical Thermodynamics: A Brief Overview** <span
id="9"></span> 
*Thermodynamics describes the behavior of huge collections of
microscopic particles through the use of such averaged properties as
temperature, density, volume, entropy, energy, and so forth. In doing
so, thermodynamics avoids the extraordinarily difficult task of directly
computing the behavior of such collections of particles by using
Newton’s equations of motion. The “dynamics” of thermodynamics has to do
with changes in these averaged properties and not with the details of
the microscopic configuration of the materials in the system.*  
  
 *However, statistical mechanics is based on one fundamental assumption:
that all possible microscopic configurations that are consistent with
the observed averaged thermodynamic properties are equally likely to
occur. This is an application of a philosophical position that has
proven extremely useful in science: that we do not occupy a special
place in the universe. (This idea is often called the “mediocrity
principle” and may originally have been introduced by
16<sup>th</sup>-century astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.) If all possible
microscopic configurations are equally likely, then the physics we
measure are most likely to be those of the most common possible
configurations. This simple principle allows us to interpret the
thermodynamic properties of materials in terms of their component
particles and the interactions between them, which in turn leads to a
more fundamental understanding of why matter behaves the way it does.*

     Instructions: Watch the video (approximately 52 minutes long),
    which begins with a review of some topics covered in Unit 8 of this
    course and then moves into a consideration of statistical mechanics.
    Pay particular attention to how you can calculate the probability of
    finding a molecule in a particular energy state. If we know the
    distribution of all the molecules of a system in its various states,
    then we can arrive at the macroscopic thermodynamic functions for
    that system. You can find the lecture notes for this video here
    (PDF).  
      
     Watching this lecture should take approximately 1 hour.
